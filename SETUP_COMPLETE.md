# MCP Team Server Setup Complete

**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: ✅ Clean & Ready

## What Was Built

A **completely empty** MCP Team Server gateway with:
- ✅ Zero tools defined
- ✅ Pure protocol layer only
- ✅ SSE and STDIO support
- ✅ Health endpoint
- ✅ Railway-ready configuration

## Current State

```
src/
├── index.ts          # STDIO server (0 tools)
└── server-http.ts    # HTTP/SSE server (0 tools)
```

**NO** tool directories exist:
- ❌ `src/tools/` - Does not exist
- ❌ `src/handlers/` - Does not exist

## Server Output

When started:
```
✅ MCP Team Server started on port 3001
✅ Loaded 0 tool definitions
⚠️  No tools defined yet - server is ready for tool definitions
```

Health check returns:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "tools": 0,
  "server": "mcp-team-server",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## What's Clean

1. **No premature tool definitions** - Tools will be designed when needed
2. **No placeholder handlers** - No confusing stub code
3. **No legacy code** - Removed all AI Content Generator references
4. **No external dependencies** - Only MCP SDK, Express, dotenv
5. **Clear comments** - Code explains it's ready for tools to be added

## Riley Integration

Riley can connect but will receive 0 tools:

```env
# Riley's .env
MCP_SERVER_URL=http://mcp-team-server.railway.internal:3001/sse
```

This is expected and correct - tools will be added later.

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Deploy Empty Gateway
1. Deploy this to Railway as `mcp-team-server`
2. Update Riley to connect
3. Verify connection works (0 tools is OK)

### Phase 2: Design Tools
1. **Decide** what tools you actually need
2. **Design** tool schemas (inputs/outputs)
3. **Plan** which tools share microservices
4. **Don't** build anything until design is complete

### Phase 3: Build Tool Microservices
1. Create separate projects for each microservice
2. Deploy microservices to Railway
3. Get microservice URLs

### Phase 4: Connect Tools to Gateway
1. Create `src/tools/` directory
2. Define tool schemas
3. Create handlers that call microservices
4. Register tools in server files

## Architecture

```
Current:
  Riley → MCP Team Server (0 tools) → Nothing

Future:
  Riley → MCP Team Server → Keyword Microservice
                         → Trending Microservice
                         → Research Microservice
```

## Files

- `README.md` - User guide (emphasizes 0 tools)
- `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This file
- `src/index.ts` - Clean STDIO server
- `src/server-http.ts` - Clean HTTP/SSE server
- `.env` - Clean config (no API keys)
- `package.json` - Minimal dependencies

## Validation

✅ Builds successfully (`npm run build`)
✅ Starts successfully (`npm start`)
✅ Health endpoint works
✅ Returns 0 tools correctly
✅ No tool directories exist
✅ No legacy code remains
✅ Documentation is accurate

**The MCP Team Server is now a clean slate, ready for thoughtful tool design and development.**
